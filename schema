This is just an example of what the schema could be


days: [
    {
        id: any,
        date_time: date time,
        name: string,
        events: ARRAY OF EVENTS,
    }
]

events: [{
  id: any,
  title: string,
  date_time: date time,
  description: string,
  members: [{
    type: string,
    name: string
  }],
  badges: [{
    color: sting-class-name,
    name: string,
  }],
  events: [{ exact spec as above }],
}]
